		<li>At the bottom of the page you see yourself and circles around you. On Health Bank we use circles for sharing. Next to the predefined circles, you can add more by clicking on the circle with the plus in it.</li>
		<li>Click on any circle to see all the people in it and to get some more options like editing the colour of the circle or changing the space assingment (If you do so, all record entries, you assigned to this circle will be assigned to the selected space).</li>
		<li>If you want to add someone to a circle, use the search function on top and enter your friends name. If the right name appears in the middle box, drag and drop it to the circle of your choice.</li>
		<li>To remove a user from a circle first click on the circle to see its member. Then drag the user to the right and drop it on the 'remove' field.</li>
		<li>We try to help researches as much as possible to find cures for diseases. If you do want to help as well, click on the 'allow research' checkbox. This will allow researchers to inspect your data anonymously for scientific purposes.</li>
