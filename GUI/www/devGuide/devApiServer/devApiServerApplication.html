			<h3>REST APIs for Applications</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				Seen from the big picture, the REST APIs for applications are built for two different operations. On one side they deal with the functionality to create and upload new applications by institute users as well as editing details, updating to the next version, changing the application icon and so forth. On the other side they are build for the actual user to access applications, illustrate them in the market, un-/install, etc. In order to deal with both of these use cases here, we have split this section of the documentation in two blocks rather than spliting it into different sections for the different servlets. 
			</p> <br><br>
			<h4>For Institute Users</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Upload:</b><br>
				Let us start by describing the installation of an app or visualization more thoroughly. If you have read the documentation of creating <a href="../devCreateApp.html">a new application</a> or <a href="../devCreateViz.html">a new visualization</a> and if you followed the <a href="../devDemos.html">demos</a> you should now have an application or a visualization locally on your machine which you would like to upload. If you do not want to use the provided GUI for it in the apps section (you need to be logged in to the system as an institute user), here is the Java Doc of the POST request of the /Application REST API which is needed to upload the application/visualization:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * With this POST request the caller (provided it is a institute user), may add new applications or visualizations to the HealthBank system.
				 * The more it shall be possible to edit existing applications/visualizations. For these two operations the caller shall use multipart content from
				 * a form.
				 * The more it shall be possible to update the app secret via a 'normal' POST request, without multipart content.
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the form:
				 * Add new item:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - icon: The icon for the new application/visualization (an actual image, png, jpeg, gif, pjpeg, svg and tiff are supported )
				 * - file: The HTML file for the application/visualization (an .html file)
				 * - css: (optional) A CSS file to use for the application/visualization (a .css file)
				 * - js: (optional) A JavaScript file to use for the application/visualization ( a .js file)
				 * - name: The name of the application/visualization
				 * - descr: A description for the application/visualization
				 * - type: The type of the new application/visualization. Can be either 'app' for an application or 'viz' for a visualization
				 * - version: A string indication the version number of the application
	 			 * - isFor: Decide if the application/visualization is visible for institutes only ('institutes'), users only ('users') or both ('all')
				 * - online: Can be either 'true' or 'false'. Depending on this value we show the application to our users or it is only visible to the author of the app
				 * - index: (only for applications) In order to make searching on the tremendous amount of data more effective, the author of an application has to give us at 
				 * 			least one and up to five keywords that are actually used for the stored records. This will be used by our index mechanism to make access easier.
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<p>
				As you can see in the documentation it is essential to use a multipart request for the purpose of uploading your application. We need to use multiparte here because of the multiple files which we like to upload including the icon for the application/visualization as well as the HTML/CSS/JS files. Apart from these files, we need to provide a name and description for the application/visualization which we like to upload. The type parameter is either 'app' for an application or 'viz' for a visualization. With the version parameter we can define a version number to it. As with almost all our API calls we need to provide the credentials and the session key with the call. <br>
				The online parameter allows the developer to define when the uploaded application/visualization is actually visible for users in the market place. You can set it to 'offline' at first, in which case only you will be able to see the application in action. This is very helpfull for testing purposes. Once you are happy with the result, you can use the editing API (further down) to set this value to 'online'. Once you have done that, users will be able to see the application/visualization in the market place.<br>
				Another important tool for the developer ist he isFor parameter which can have one of the following values: 'users', 'institutes', 'all'. With this value you can define which type of users that do have access to your application/visualization. This might be helpful if you develop e.g. an application for medical professionals which would not be appropriate for users to see. <br>
				Finally there is the index parameter. As we gather a lot of information from a variety of different applications it gets more and more tricky to find certain records the users are looking for. In order to help us to improve the search experiece we encourage you to tell us one to five keywords which are moste important for an entry added by your application. We might use this for indexing and improving the overall search experience. Thank you for being as acurate as possible with this. As visualizations are not allowed to produce records, this parameter is not needed if you add a new visualization.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				<b>Edit:</b><br>
				Editing an application/visualization uses the same API as for uploading a new one. The Java Doc therefore looks quite similar:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * With this POST request the caller (provided it is a institute user), may add new applications or visualizations to the HealthBank system.
				 * The more it shall be possible to edit existing applications/visualizations. For these two operations the caller shall use multipart content from
				 * a form.
				 * The more it shall be possible to update the app secret via a 'normal' POST request, without multipart content.
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the form:
				 * Edit existing item:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - id: The if of the application/visualization to edit
				 * - icon: The icon for the new application/visualization (an actual image, png, jpeg, gif, pjpeg, svg and tiff are supported )
				 * - file: The HTML file for the application/visualization (an .html file)
				 * - css: (optional) A CSS file to use for the application/visualization (a .css file)
				 * - js: (optional) A JavaScript file to use for the application/visualization ( a .js file)
				 * - name: The name of the application/visualization
				 * - descr: A description for the application/visualization
				 * - whatsNew: A message on what has changed between the old and new version
				 * - version: A string indication the version number of the application
				 * - isFor: Decide if the application/visualization is visible for institutes only ('institutes'), users only ('users') or both ('all')
				 * - online: Can be either 'true' or 'false'. Depending on this value we show the application to our users or it is only visible to the author of the app
				 * - index: (only for applications) In order to make searching on the tremendous amount of data more effective, the author of an application has to give us at 
				 * 			least one and up to five keywords that are actually used for the stored records. This will be used by our index mechanism to make access easier.
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<p>
				Obviously there is the id parameter, which you will not find in the uploading procedure. This is used to tell the system which application/visualization that will be updated. The more there is the whatsNew parameter which gives the developer the possibility to tell the user what changed in this new version with regard to the last one. As you will have noticed the type parameter is missing in this API, which has the obvious reason that you can not transform an application to a visualization or the other way round. 
				<br><br>
				Deleting applications is not supported so far. If you want to delete your application for whatever reason, please contact Health Bank<sup>&copy;</sup> directly.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				<b>Secret:</b><br>
				Every application will get a secret which is only visible for the author. This secret is used to get a token in order to upload records to the system directly from another server as described <a href="../devCreateApp.html">here</a>. If for some reason someone else got in possesion of your secret or you feel that it might not be secure anymore, we provide you with an API to change and renew the secret. It is again the same /Application REST API as for inserting and editing applications/visualizations and you still have to use a POST request. But for this request you shall not use a multicast request. The straight forward explanation is given via the Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * With this POST request the caller (provided it is a institute user), may add new applications or visualizations to the HealthBank system.
				 * The more it shall be possible to edit existing applications/visualizations. For these two operations the caller shall use multipart content from
				 * a form.
				 * The more it shall be possible to update the app secret via a 'normal' POST request, without multipart content.
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the form:
				 * Get a new app secret:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - id: The if of the application/visualization to edit
				 * - secret: The existing secret for the application
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 * 
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<p>If you do not know your secret, please log into the GUI and click on the gear icon next to the respective application/visualization in the 'uploaded' list of all your uploaded applications/visualizations</p><br>
			<p>
				<b id="queryInstitute">Query:</b><br>
				The GET request on the /Application API can be used for two things. First it will return all the applications and visualizations present and set to 'online' in the system. If additionally the 'optional' parameter is provided to response will contain all the uploaded applications the current institute is the author of. Apart from the optional 'uploaded' parameter it is straight forward and has no other parameters then the credentials and session for authentication. Again have a look on the Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * With this GET request the caller can query all the applications in the system or by providing the 'uploaded' parameter
				 * all it uploaded personally if it is an institute user.
				 * to the HealthBank system so far. For other queries to the application collection, please use the {@link AppQuery} servlet.
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the URL:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - uploaded: (optional) If you are an institute user, set any value to this attribute to get all the applications and visualizations you have uploaded so far
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 *
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>For 'Normal' Users</h4>
			<p>
				Let us talk about the different query possibilities first. As we have just seen <a href="#queryInstitute">in the Java Doc before</a> the query to the /Application REST API as a user will return all the applications/visualizations there are. The option with the 'uploaded' parameter is certainly not possible for a normal user. This query is especially usefull for the market place. But let us now go through the /AppQuery (or /appquery, /aq, /Appquery) API which supports only different GET requests. So far there are three different ways on how to make this GET request:
			</p><br>
			<p>
				<b>Query by Id:</b><br>
				First there is the query for a single application/visualization by providing the respective object id. To distinguish whether the caller is asking for an application or a visualization the type parameter is used. Again this parameter may have the values 'app' for application or 'viz' for visualization. Here is the according Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * The GET request allows the caller to query for applications and visualizations. There are multiple ways of calling this method. 
				 * Either one can query a specific application/visualization by its id or query applications/visualizations by a query string. If the
				 * caller neither provides the id nor the query parameter, all the applications/visualizations the current user has installed, are
				 * returned. The parameter type which can have the values "app" or "viz" determines if the caller likes the receive results of type 
				 * application or visualization.
				 * 
				 * With id:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - id: The id of a specific application/visualization
				 * - type: Can have values "app" or "viz" to decide if we query for applications or visualizations
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 * 
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Query by a query string:</b><br>
				To make a more sophisticated query we provide this API. You can ask a query by providing a query string which might be a name of an application, or only part of it. The API also searches in the description of the applications and the author field to get a match. Again you have to decide whether to query for applications or visualizations via the type parameter. Here is the according Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * The GET request allows the caller to query for applications and visualizations. There are multiple ways of calling this method. 
				 * Either one can query a specific application/visualization by its id or query applications/visualizations by a query string. If the
				 * caller neither provides the id nor the query parameter, all the applications/visualizations the current user has installed, are
				 * returned. The parameter type which can have the values "app" or "viz" determines if the caller likes the receive results of type 
				 * application or visualization.
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the URL:
				 * With query:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - query: A query string which should match applications/visualizations with similar strings in attributes name, descr or institute name
				 * - type: Can have values "app" or "viz" to decide if we query for applications or visualizations
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 * 
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Query installed applications/visualizations:</b><br>
				The last of the three query methods allows the caller to retrieve all the applications or visualizations he or she has installed so far. Again the type parameter decides between the two. Here is the according Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * The GET request allows the caller to query for applications and visualizations. There are multiple ways of calling this method. 
				 * Either one can query a specific application/visualization by its id or query applications/visualizations by a query string. If the
				 * caller neither provides the id nor the query parameter, all the applications/visualizations the current user has installed, are
				 * returned. The parameter type which can have the values "app" or "viz" determines if the caller likes the receive results of type 
				 * application or visualization.
				 * 
				 * Without query or id:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - type: Can have values "app" or "viz" to decide if we query for applications or visualizations
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server) 
				 * 
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
				Querying is nice, be we also want users to install and uninstall applications and to let them assign circles and spaces to all the records which are added by a specific application. To fullfill these tasks we introduce the /AppInstall (or /appinstall, /appInstall) API. This API supports GET and POST requests. We start with the POST requests and show you the GET query <a href="#queryInstall">later on</a>.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				<b>Un-/Install an application / a visualization:</b><br>
				In order to install or uninstall an application or a visualization you have to call the POST request with the id of the application/visualization. The system will check if you already have the item installed or not and will therefore un-/install it. As always you have to provide your credentials and session key. Here is the according Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * The POST request allows the caller to install and uninstall applications or visualizations for the currently logged in user. If the application 
				 * or visualization is already registered with the user, it will be uninstalled. Else we install and register it with the user. 
				 * So far we only remember which application/visualization the user actually wanted to install. There is no more functionality yet. Likewise when the 
				 * application/visualization gets uninstalled, we only delete the reference on the user site. All records that were added by the application/visualization 
				 * will remain in the database and continue to be visible for the user and the people allowed to see it via circles. 
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the URL:
				 * Un-/Install:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - id: The id of the application or visualization the user wants to install or uninstall to or from his account.
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 * 
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Add circles to an application:</b><br>
				With this feature we allow the user to select none, one or multiple circles to assign with the application. The idea behind this is, that the user by doing so tells the system that starting now all record entries which will be added by the specified application will automatically be visible by the corresponding circle(s). Of course the user will still be able to change the circles of every record individually afterwards. Here is the according Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * The POST request allows the caller to install and uninstall applications or visualizations for the currently logged in user. If the application 
				 * or visualization is already registered with the user, it will be uninstalled. Else we install and register it with the user. 
				 * So far we only remember which application/visualization the user actually wanted to install. There is no more functionality yet. Likewise when the 
				 * application/visualization gets uninstalled, we only delete the reference on the user site. All records that were added by the application/visualization 
				 * will remain in the database and continue to be visible for the user and the people allowed to see it via circles. 
				 * 
				 * Change circles of installed app:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - id: The id of the application or visualization the user wants to change.
				 * - circles: A list of selected circle ID's separated by a whitespace
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 * 
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br><p>
				<b>Add spaces to an application:</b><br>
				Similar then before we allow the user to select none, one or multiple spaces to assign with the application. This will have the effect, that all future record entries of the specified application will be visible in the according space. Of course, again, the user will still be able to change the spaces of every record individually afterwards. Here is the according Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * The POST request allows the caller to install and uninstall applications or visualizations for the currently logged in user. If the application 
				 * or visualization is already registered with the user, it will be uninstalled. Else we install and register it with the user.

				 * - spaces: A list of selected space ID's separated by a whitespace
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server) 
				 * 
				 */
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<br><p>
				<b id="queryInstall">Query installation information:</b><br>
				Setting circles and spaces to an application is nice, but we also want to know what circles and spaces we assigned to a certain app later on. Therefore we provide the GET request to the /AppInstall API. Given the application id this will return the spaces and circles assigned to the application by the user if the he or she actually has installed the application and has assigned circles/spaces. Here is the according Java Doc:
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
