			<h3>REST APIs for Profile Entries</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				This category actually contains four different servlets or API's. Two of them are similar to the ones described in the <a href="devApiServerRecord.html">record</a> section and deal with editing profile data, changing user icon and different forms of queries. The other two are responsible for dealing with circles and spaces, creating, editing and deleting them. We will start with the <a href="#profile">/Profile API</a>, continue with the <a href="#userQuery">user query</a> one and will then go to the API's for <a href="#spaces">spaces</a> and <a href="#circles">circles</a>. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4 id="profile">/Profile servlet</h4>
			<p>
				This API deals with all kind of editing for the user profile as well as querying information about the currently logged in user. Creating new users is not part of this API since this is done via the <a href="devAPIServerUserAuth.html#register">/Register</a> API. As you should know by now for all the requests, POST and GET, you will need to provide the session and credentials parameters for the current user in order to be able to access anything on the server. We start with the GET request followed by the different POST requests.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				<b>Get profile information:</b><br>
				This is a rather straight forward GET request to retrieve the different values for the current user. Hence the Java Doc is rather short:  
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**
				 * The GET request allows the caller to query all the profile data of the provided user. 
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the URL:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 * 
				 * The user data is stored in the 'values.user' field of the returning JSON
				*/
			]]></script>
			<br>
			<p>
				As an example, here is a possible request and the response (session and credentials are shown as '*' only for security reasons):<br>
				GET -> <i>http://129.132.227.147:8080/HealthBank/Profile?session=*&credentials=*</i><br>

				As you see there are quite a few details which you get here. Not all the fields are very usefull to the caller at first, but this record is pulled in nearly every page, so some fields get more interesting for certain instances. Apart from 'normal' profile information fields, here are a few we like to talk a bit more about. The profileRecordId field points to a record which stores a copy of all the 'normal profile information fields. Since we store them as a record, the user can add his or her profile to circles if he or she desires to. This will allow people assigned to the same circle to view data like date of birth, address, insurance company, height and weight etc. It goes without saying that this record will always be updated, whenever there is a change to this data. The user icon field is a link to the file stored in the database. Use the <a href="devApiServerFile.html">/File</a> API to retrieve it. The allowResearch field is used in the circles page and allowes the user to add a special research circle. All records the users assigns to this circle will be visible for research companies registered on our site. The haveMeInCircle array is a shortcut to get to know immediately and without another query which other user that have the current one in out of their circles. So in other words, it tells you which other users might potentially share records with the current user. The session management is described in the <a href="devAPIServerUserAuth.html">authentication section</a>.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				<b>Edit profile:</b><br>
				This POST API is responsible for the editing of the profile. There are many ways of calling this request with regard to the parameters used. Apart from credentials and session you may only set a single parameter (as for example when you would like to update the password) or set multiple of them. You find the complete list of possible parameters in the Java Doc: 
			</p><br>
			<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
				/**

			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Edit profile icon:</b><br>
				In order to change the user icon you will have to make a multipart POST request to /Profile. Do not forget to add the credentials and session to the form data. <br>
				So far we only support PNG images up to a size of 20kb. This might change in future releases. For completion, here is the Java Doc:

			<h4 id="userQuery">/UserQuery servlet</h4>
			<p>
				The /UserQuery (or /userquery, /uq) allows the caller to make different queries on the user database. There is a query for a single user via an id, a query using a query string to search in the database and finally a query that will return all users in your circles. All these requests are done via a GET request. Please remember that there is a difference between a normal user with the values as seen above and a institute or company user. The later does look like this:<br>
				<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js"><![CDATA[

				Compared to the normal user this has no first- and lastname but a companyname. The more it has a field called descr which is a description of the company itself. Fields like height and weight, insurance or spouse do not make sence in this environment and hence are omitted. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Query by id:</b><br>
				To query a special user, use the id of that user. Please notice that if the other user has not allowed you to see his profile, the information you will get is rather minimalistic. As soon as the user has put his profile and you in the same circle, you will get all the profile information you need. Here is the Java Doc:

				This servlet allowes via GET requests to query spaces in different ways as described in detail below. Via the POST request the user can add new spaces and edit the information about it. In a future version it might also allow to add circles to a space witch would mean that all the records in the particular space and records that will be assigned to this space in future will automatically be assigned to this circle.

				As described before the 'manipulation of circles in the space' as illustrated in the documentation above is not yet existing and will be introduced in a future version.

			<h4 id="circles">/Circle servlet</h4>
			<p>
				The /Circle servlet is in many regards similar to the spaces one. The GET requests are the same, hence we will show you the Java Doc of all three together later on. The POST requests for creating and editing a circle are also very similar to the ones from the spaces API. Again we will show them together. The features to add and remove users from circles as well as deleting circles are show seperately afterwards.

				<b>GET requests:</b><br>

				/**
				 * The GET request allows the caller to return one or more specific circle(s). There are three different possibilities to make this call.
				 * By providing the 'name' parameter we search for the circle with exact this name. By providing the 'id' attribute we do the same for
				 * circles with this id. And finally if the caller omits both of these parameters, we will return all the circles of the given user.
				 * 
				 * For a successful call the following parameters need to be present in the URL:
				 * By name:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - name: The name of the circle to search for
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)
				 * 
				 * By id:
				 * - credentials: This is a credentials string combining the password and user name in a hashed form for security.
				 * - session: This is the current session key of the user
				 * - id: The id of the circle to search for
				 * - (callback: (optional) For JSONP requests, one can add the callback parameter, which will result in a JSONP response from the server)

				<b>Delete a circles:</b><br>
				Deleting a circle is very similar. All we need is the id and authentication. The del parameter is used to tell the system that you really want to delete something. Here is the Java Doc entry:

				<b>Add a user to a circles:</b><br>
				In order to add a user to a circle we need to define both the circle id and the user id.  Here is the Java Doc entry:

			<p>
				<b>Remove a user from a circles:</b><br>
				The same goes for removing a user again from a circle. The more, as when we deleted the cirlce, we need to set the del parameter. Here is the Java Doc entry:
